This is an AJAX shopping list designed for a group of people who want to share and edit a single list using various mobile devices.

The basic architecture is a single PHP page with a lot of Javascript hooks that when tapped, call asynchronously into server-side PHP to interact with the list. All of these interactions have callbacks that go refresh the list when the server is done saving the modification.

Outstanding features under construction as of 7/15/12 are:
-Ability to create multiple lists (currently this code does not scale at all)
-Automatic creation of the favorites list (or at least non-hardcoded storage)
