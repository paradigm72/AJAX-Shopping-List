This is an AJAX shopping list designed for a group of people who want to share and edit a single list using various mobile devices.

The basic architecture is a single Angular controller with a ShoppingList model, and a few directives to hide some complexity around editing existing items. Server-side functionality is in PHP scripts that save and load from flat files.

This only operates on a single file and isn't scalable at all to multiple lists or modes. It handles concurrency only in that it prevents obvious data integrity errors and the most common scenarios - complex simultaneous edits are typically rejected rather than handled.

Under consideration for future development:
-Potentially move list items into the AngularJS "resource" framework to abstract away loading/saving a bit more
-Add ability to flag items for certain stores or categories, e.g. "grocery store" vs. "hardware store"
-Keep tweaking the focus logic for the text boxes to handle more scenarios
-Larger framework to handle toggling between different lists entirely
-Remember favorite items and offer them as suggestions
